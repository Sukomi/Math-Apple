# Math Apple

This project is a 4 fun experiment to replicate Mathway and render vidoes on it.

## How 2 Use

Set up a venv under the mathway folder by using "py -3 -m venv .venv"

Then activate the environment using: ".venv\Scripts\activate"

Once the env is active install the needed libraries with: "pip install -r requirements.txt"

You can add your own frames in the frames folder. The format for frames are "frame{{frame number}}" starting from a frame number of 1.

To run activate the environment and use: "python server.py"

Once it processes all of the frames use: "ng serve" to start running the web app and open the link. To run the render just type apple into the input box.
